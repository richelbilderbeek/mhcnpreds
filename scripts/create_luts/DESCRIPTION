Description: 
    The human immune system has MHC class I and class II molecules
    that bind peptide fragments with different strength.
    This binding strength is determined by the peptide fragment (i.e.
    does it fit?) and the type of MHC molecule (aka the haplotype).
    We can predict the binding strength of a peptide and an MHC molecule
    of a certain haplotype with software.
    This package compares the predictions of two such prediction tools:
    'EpitopePrediction' and 'MHCnuggets'.
